QWebDAV library (qwebdavlib) version 1.0 (LGPL v2.1)

Changes* for version 1.0
    - Simple structure:
        * QWebdav inherits QNetworkAccessManager and is used to create
          requests and puts
        * QWebdavDirParser inherits QObject and is used together with QWebdav
          to request a directory listing and subsequent parsing of the
          response. QWebdavDirParser::getList() returns a QList of QWebdavItem.
        * QWebdavItem is used to handle all data related to a file or
          a directory
        * QNaturalSort make the function naturalCompare from
          http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/gui/dialogs/qfilesystemmodel.cpp
          available for QWebdavDirParser to sort directory listings
    - SSL support added, so that certificates can be accepted explicitly
      with their MD5 and SHA1 digests. The lib can now also handle self-signed
      certificates which are not signed by a system-wide accepted certification
      authority (CA).
    - Source property has been removed (lack of support according to RFC4918)
    - Added custom port support
    - Added support of root path, which is prepended to the path
      argument of functions from class QWebdav, so that the root path can be used
      as WebDAV share path. The path arguments are relative to
      the root path.
    - FIX: request header destination (copy/move) has to be an absolute URI
    - username and password are not any longer part of the m_baseURL
      in qwebdav.cpp. They are only used to set parameters of QAuthenticator.
    - WebDAV server dependent handling of href of PROPFIND responses
      (Apache returns path without scheme and authority and
      MS IIS returns full URL)

* in comparison to the initial libraries
